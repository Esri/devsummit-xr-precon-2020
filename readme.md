* ‚ùì My solution won't build
    * üí° Ensure that you've restored Nuget packages. Right click on your solution and select **Restore Nuget Packages**.
* ‚ùì I'm getting Android resource errors with the starter solutions.
    * üí° Try deploying the project to device. This will trigger a rebuild of the Android Resources.
* ‚ùì I'm getting `File not found` or `maxpath` errors when trying to build.
    * üí° Windows limits the lengths of paths, and this can cause problems with Xamarin projects. Either move the solution closer to the root of your drive, or create a _directory junction_ and build from there.
      > ```sh
      > mklink /J "C:\dev" "C:\some\long\path\starter_projects\..."
      > ```
* ‚ùì I can't restore the Nuget packages or I'm seeing hundreds of build errors that I can't resolve.
    * üí° In the Visual Studio toolbar, navigate to **Tools->Nuget Package Manager->Package Manager Settings**, then select **Package Sources**. Verify that **nuget.org** is enabled and its source is set to `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`. Disable all other sources; a single failing source will prevent any packages from restoring.
* ‚ùì I'm having trouble deploying to my iOS device through my mac.
    * üí° This one can be tricky. Don't spend too much time on this before asking a session leader for help.

## Resources

### Local data for use with AR

Finding good data is one of the hardest parts of building a world-scale AR app. We've collected some data that you may find useful while working with AR at DevSummit:

* [AR DevSummit group on ArcGIS Online]()
    * [PSCC MMPK with locator]() - this locator can be used for indoor routing at the convention center
    * [PSCC feature layer]() - layer can be used for visualizing conference center features
